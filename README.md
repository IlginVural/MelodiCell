# MelodiCell

MelodiCell is an AI-supported music therapy application created in response to the insufficiency of personalized psychological support systems based on individuals' mental states. In today's world, with the increase in feelings of stress, anxiety, and emotional burnout, access to professional psychological support remains limited. Based on these issues, MelodiCell aims to provide personalized music-based digital therapy support according to individuals' mental needs.

In order to detect the user's current psychological state, Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) technology is used to determine basic emotional status with an AI model. Additionally, strong emotion analysis is performed based on written data gathered from short conversations carried out with the AI. From this data, a personalized music composition is created for the user. The generated music serves psychological goals such as emotional balancing, relaxation, focusing, and anxiety reduction, which support the therapy process and can be adjusted based on these targets.

In this way, MelodiCell helps increase the user's psychological awareness and provides an opportunity for psychologists and therapists to integrate digital technologies into their sessions. By combining music and technology, MelodiCell offers users a personalized, accessible, and simplified mental support tool.
